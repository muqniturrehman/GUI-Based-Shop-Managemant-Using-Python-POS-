Billing System
Overview
This project is a billing system implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to manage products, create bills for customers, add items to the bill, edit items, delete items, view bills, and generate cash memos. The billing system also includes a calculator feature accessible from the GUI.

Features
Manage Products: Users can manage products by adding, editing, and deleting product details such as name, quantity, and unit price.
Create Bills: Users can create bills for customers by entering their details and adding items to the bill.
Edit Items: Items in the bill can be edited to update their details such as quantity or unit price.
Delete Items: Items can be removed from the bill if they are no longer needed.
View Bills: Users can view bills by searching by bill number, customer name, date range, or listing all bills.
Generate Cash Memos: Users can generate cash memos for bills.
Calculator: The system includes a calculator feature accessible from the GUI.
Implementation
The project uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles with classes like BillItem and BillingApp to represent items in the bill and manage the billing application.
Tkinter is used for the GUI, with menus for different functionalities like managing products, creating bills, viewing bills, generating cash memos, and accessing the calculator.
The database functionality is implemented using SQLite to store product information, bill details, and bill items.
Separate modules are used for managing products, viewing bills, and the calculator feature.
